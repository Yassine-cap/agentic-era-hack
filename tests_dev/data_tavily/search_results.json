The Future of Jobs Report 2025 brings together the perspective of over 1,000 leading global employers\u2014collectively representing more than 14 million workers across 22 industry clusters and 55 economies from around the world\u2014to examine how these macrotrends impact jobs and skills, and the workforce transformation strategies employers plan to embark on in response, across the 2025 to 2030 timeframe.\n\nBroadening digital access is expected to be the most transformative trend \u2013 both across technology-related trends and overall \u2013 with 60% of employers expecting it to transform their business by 2030. Advancements in technologies, particularly AI and information processing (86%); robotics and automation (58%); and energy generation, storage and distribution (41%), are also expected to be transformative. These trends are expected to have a divergent effect on jobs, driving both the fastest-growing and fastest-declining roles, and fueling demand for technology-related skills, including AI and big data, networks and cybersecurity and technological literacy, which are anticipated to be the top three fastest- growing skills.\nIncreasing cost of living ranks as the second- most transformative trend overall \u2013 and the top trend related to economic conditions \u2013 with half of employers expecting it to transform their business by 2030, despite an anticipated reduction in global inflation. General economic slowdown, to a lesser extent, also remains top of mind and is expected to transform 42% of businesses. Inflation is predicted to have a mixed outlook for net job creation to 2030, while slower growth is expected to displace 1.6 million jobs globally. These two impacts on job creation are expected to increase the demand for creative thinking and resilience, flexibility, and agility skills.\nClimate-change mitigation is the third-most transformative trend overall \u2013 and the top trend related to the green transition \u2013 while climate-change adaptation ranks sixth with 47% and 41% of employers, respectively, expecting these trends to transform their business in the next five years. This is driving demand for roles such as renewable energy engineers, environmental engineers and electric and autonomous vehicle specialists, all among the 15 fastest-growing jobs. Climate trends are also expected to drive an increased focus on environmental stewardship, which has entered the Future of Jobs Report\u2019s list of top 10 fastest growing skills for the first time.\nTwo demographic shifts are increasingly seen to be transforming global economies and labour markets: aging and declining working age populations, predominantly in higher- income economies, and expanding working age populations, predominantly in lower-income economies. These trends drive an increase in demand for skills in talent management, teaching and mentoring, and motivation and self-awareness. Aging populations drive growth in healthcare jobs such as nursing professionals, while growing working-age populations fuel growth in education-related professions, such as higher education teachers.\nGeoeconomic fragmentation and geopolitical tensions are expected to drive business model transformation in one-third (34%) of surveyed organizations in the next five years. Over one- fifth (23%) of global employers identify increased restrictions on trade and investment, as well as subsidies and industrial policies (21%), as factors shaping their operations. Almost all economies for which respondents expect these trends to be most transformative have significant trade with the United States and/or China. Employers who expect geoeconomic trends to transform their business are also more likely to offshore \u2013 and even more likely to re-shore \u2013 operations. These trends are driving demand for security related job roles and increasing demand for network and cybersecurity skills. They are also increasing demand for other human-centred skills such as resilience, flexibility and agility skills, and leadership and social influence.\nExtrapolating from the predictions shared by Future of Jobs Survey respondents, on current trends over the 2025 to 2030 period job creation and destruction due to structural labour-market transformation will amount to 22% of today\u2019s total jobs.

However, this growth is expected to be offset by the displacement of the equivalent of 8% (or 92 million) of current jobs, resulting in net growth of 7% of total employment, or 78 million jobs.\nFrontline job roles are predicted to see the largest growth in absolute terms of volume and include Farmworkers, Delivery Drivers, Construction Workers, Salespersons, and Food Processing Workers. Care economy jobs, such as Nursing Professionals, Social Work and Counselling Professionals and Personal Care Aides are also expected to grow significantly over the next five years, alongside Education roles such as Tertiary and Secondary Education Teachers.\nTechnology-related roles are the fastest- growing jobs in percentage terms, including Big Data Specialists, Fintech Engineers, AI and Machine Learning Specialists and Software and Application Developers. Green and energy transition roles, including Autonomous and Electric Vehicle Specialists, Environmental Engineers, and Renewable Energy Engineers, also feature within the top fastest-growing roles.\nClerical and Secretarial Workers \u2013 including Cashiers and Ticket Clerks, and Administrative Assistants and Executive Secretaries \u2013 are expected to see the largest decline in absolute numbers. Similarly, businesses expect the fastest-declining roles to include Postal Service Clerks, Bank Tellers and Data Entry Clerks.\nOn average, workers can expect that two-fifths (39%) of their existing skill sets will be transformed or become outdated over the 2025-2030 period. However, this measure of \u201cskill instability\u201d has slowed compared to previous editions of the report, from 44% in 2023 and a high point of 57% in 2020 in the wake of the pandemic. This finding could potentially be due to an increasing share of workers (50%) having completed training, reskilling or upskilling measures, compared to 41% in the report\u2019s 2023 edition.\nAnalytical thinking remains the most sought- after core skill among employers, with seven out of 10 companies considering it as essential in 2025. This is followed by resilience, flexibility and agility, along with leadership and social influence.\nAI and big data top the list of fastest-growing skills, followed closely by networks and cybersecurity as well as technology literacy. Complementing these technology-related skills, creative thinking, resilience, flexibility and agility, along with curiosity and lifelong learning, are also expected to continue to rise in importance over the 2025-2030 period. Conversely, manual dexterity, endurance and precision stand out with notable net declines in skills demand, with 24% of respondents foreseeing a decrease in their importance.\nWhile global job numbers are projected to grow by 2030, existing and emerging skills differences between growing and declining roles could exacerbate existing skills gaps. The most prominent skills differentiating growing from declining jobs are anticipated to comprise resilience, flexibility and agility; resource management and operations; quality control; programming and technological literacy.\nGiven these evolving skill demands, the scale of workforce upskilling and reskilling expected to be needed remains significant: if the world\u2019s workforce was made up of 100 people, 59 would need training by 2030. Of these, employers foresee that 29 could be upskilled in their current roles and 19 could be upskilled and redeployed elsewhere within their organization. However, 11 would be unlikely to receive the reskilling or upkskilling needed, leaving their employment prospects increasingly at risk.\nSkill gaps are categorically considered the biggest barrier to business transformation by Future of Jobs Survey respondents, with 63% of employers identifying them as a major barrier over the 2025- 2030 period. Accordingly, 85% of employers surveyed plan to prioritize upskilling their workforce, with 70% of employers expecting to hire staff with new skills, 40% planning to reduce staff as their skills become less relevant, and 50% planning to transition staff from declining to growing roles.\nSupporting employee health and well-being is expected to be a top focus for talent attraction, with 64% of employers surveyed identifying it as a key strategy to increase talent availability. Effective reskilling and upskilling initiatives, along with improving talent progression and promotion, are also seen as holding high potential for talent attraction. Funding for - and provision of - reskilling and upskilling are seen as the two most welcomed public policies to boost talent availability.\nThe Future of Jobs Survey also finds that adoption of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives remains on the rise. The potential for expanding talent availability by tapping into diverse talent pools is highlighted by four times more employers (47%) than two years ago (10%). Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives have become more prevalent, with 83% of employers reporting such an initiative in place, compared to 67% in 2023. Such initiatives are particularly popular for companies headquartered in North America, with a 96% uptake rate, and for employers with over 50,000 employees (95%).\nBy 2030, just over half of employers (52%) anticipate allocating a greater share of their revenue to wages, with only 7% expecting this share to decline. Wage strategies are driven primarily by goals of aligning wages with workers\u2019 productivity and performance and competing for retaining talent and skills. Finally, half of employers plan to re- orient their business in response to AI, two-thirds plan to hire talent with specific AI skills, while 40% anticipate reducing their workforce where AI can automate tasks.\nAbout us\n\nOur mission\nOur Institutional Framework\nHistory\nLeadership and governance\nOur Impact\n\nMore from the Forum\n\nCentres\nMeetings\nStakeholders\nForum stories\nPress releases\nPicture gallery\nPodcasts\nVideos\n\nEngage with us\n\nSign in\nPartner with us\nBecome a member\nSign up for our press releases\nSubscribe to our newsletters\nContact us\n\nQuick links\n\nSustainability at the Forum\nCareers\n\nLanguage editions\n\nEN\u25aa\nES\u25aa\n\u4e2d\u6587\u25aa\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n\n\nPrivacy Policy & Terms of Service\nSitemap\n\u00a9 2025 World Economic Forum",

Posted wage growth slowed to a strong but sustainable pace, and hiring employers\u2019 use of benefits, pay transparency, and skills-based hiring processes grew to attract workers.\nNow, after several years of speculation and unrealized recession fears, the runway for an elusive economic soft landing \u2014 in which economic activity and inflation cool to more sustainable levels without widespread job losses or other adverse economic impacts \u2014 is finally coming into view for 2025. As the labor market makes its approach, it will be essential to monitor the economy\u2019s heading, altitude, and speed to determine whether we maintain a smooth glide path, run into turbulence, land hard, or even blow past the runway in a no-landing scenario in which economic activity and inflation drastically re-accelerate. The labor market has been softening, but, over the past few years, has largely done so from a position of strength. That strength represented a cushion against mounting headwinds, but that cushion has now largely faded, and the margin for error is narrower today than it has been at any point in recent memory.\nAs we enter 2025, several data points and trends will tell us where we are in relation to the ground and how far we\u2019ve got to go. Here is what to expect if you\u2019re expecting a soft landing in 2025:\n\nHiring and quitting cannot fall, and unemployment and layoffs cannot rise: After declining to their lowest levels in a decade, hiring and quitting need to stop falling and start stabilizing \u2014 or better yet, gradually improve \u2014 in order to avoid a rough landing. At the same time, unemployment and layoffs need to remain at or near their current low levels.\nA pickup in job growth will depend on a pickup in job openings: Employer demand (job openings/postings) and monthly payroll gains will also need to stabilize or begin picking up. Substantial declines below pre-pandemic levels could signal a broader economic slowdown.\nEmployers must figure out how to do more with less: The US will have to find a way to overcome the short and long-term impacts of a dwindling labor supply as the population ages and immigration returns to pre-pandemic trends.\u00a0\nWage growth and inflation must strike a tricky balance: Wage growth needs to stabilize at or near current levels to preserve real income gains for workers. However, looming labor shortages may force employers to pay workers more than anticipated, which could push up prices and reignite inflation. Right now, the market is broadly balanced between the two, but maintaining that balance may be difficult.\nAI & GenAI tools start to meaningfully boost worker productivity: Growing generative AI adoption could serve as a critical productivity booster and may offset some labor shortage effects, particularly in industries slow to embrace innovation.\nEmployers must continue to embrace flexibility: A growing focus on reducing degree and experience requirements, and boosting skills-based hiring practices, may provide another path to address labor supply challenges.\n\nThis report will examine these trends, including the current path and potential headwinds or tailwinds each one may face in 2025.\nThe US economy is solid, but there\u2019s little room for continued softening in 2025\nThings are looking decent for the US economy heading into 2025. The labor market continued to cool this year, but unemployment and layoffs remained reassuringly low. Wage growth exceeded the rate of inflation for much of the year as inflation continued to retreat, leading to increased real spending power for many workers. Real GDP growth clocked in around 3% over the last two quarters, and consumer spending data remains solid. But are these otherwise respectable data points just the silver lining for mounting storm clouds?\nOne of the clearest indications of a cooling labor market has been the ongoing pullback in job postings from their March 2022 peak. As of November 2024, the Indeed Job Posting Index was down 10% over the year, though still 10% above pre-pandemic levels. Federal job openings data reflect a similar trend, with official openings standing 11% above February 2020 levels on the last business day of October, despite cooling from last year. While these data reflect continued employer demand and resilience in the labor market, we are approaching a point where further cooling may begin to translate into rising unemployment.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cUS job openings and postings track each other\u201d with a vertical axis from 60 to 150. The graph covers from January 31, 2020, to November 29, 2024. It shows that the Indeed Job Posting Index (blue line) tends to move similarly to federal JOLTS data (pink line).\nJob gains are slowing in key industries\nAnother sign of labor market softening has been slowing job gains. In 2023, the economy added an average of 251,000 jobs per month, well above the pre-pandemic pace of 166,000. That average has fallen to 180,000 jobs through the first eleven months of 2024 \u2014\u00a0which is above the roughly 100,000/month pace needed to keep up with population growth, but well below previous years\u2019 clips. To achieve a soft landing in 2025, payroll gains must continue to be robust enough to keep up with population growth to meet the Federal Reserve\u2019s goal of full employment.\n\nA bar chart titled \u201cMonthly job gains are declining.\u201d The chart shows data from January 2021 to November 2024. The 3-month average monthly change in nonfarm payroll growth has slowed dramatically in recent years, but remains above the pace needed to keep up with population growth.\nA smooth landing will also likely require more broad-based job gains next year. In addition to the slowing overall pace of job creation, those jobs that have been added in 2024 have been primarily concentrated in just three industries: health care & social assistance, government, and leisure & hospitality, which combined represented almost 75% of all jobs added in the last 12 months. Already somewhat concerning, this concentration could become even more worrisome in 2025 if these industries run out of steam \u2014 and there are some indications that they are.\nThe leisure and hospitality sector added an average of 47,000 jobs per month in the first eleven months of 2023, but just 23,000 per month in the first 11 months of this year. Average monthly gains in government employment have also dropped in 2024, from 58,000 to 38,000, and government hiring is likely to continue to fall in 2025 if President-elect Trump follows through on campaign promises to eliminate many government positions. Job gains in health care & social assistance this year have been roughly the same as in 2023, but openings and hiring rates in the industry have softened from previous years, a potential sign of fewer job gains to come.\nHires and quits are near decade-lows\nThe pullback in hiring has been even more pronounced among other industries. As of October, hires rates were below pre-pandemic (February 2020) levels in 9 of the 13 major industries defined by the federal government. The information (tech) and construction industries have experienced the largest drop in hires rates, with the rate in each currently below pre-pandemic levels by a percentage point or more. Despite a slight pickup in recent months, slower industry hiring in 2024 has led to the lowest overall hires rate since 2013 (excluding March/April 2020 due to pandemic distortions).\nThe hires rate fell to a recent low of 3.3% over the summer, bounced back to 3.5% in September, then returned to 3.3% in October. Looking ahead, hiring in 2025 will likely remain lower than in past years, but the recent upward trend is an encouraging sign that things might be picking back up. To stay on the glide path toward a soft landing, we would ideally see the rate gradually climb back toward or even match its 2019 average of 3.9%. Sideways movement or slow gains are acceptable for now, but an extended decline below current levels could risk stalling the plane before arrival.\n\nA chart titled \u201cHires rate by US industry sector\u201d shows the hires rate for various industry sectors in September 2024 and February 2020. With a few exceptions, most sectors had a hires rate in September below their pre-pandemic rate.\u00a0\nLike hiring, quits are a good indicator of labor market dynamics and job seeker confidence. Workers tend to feel more comfortable quitting when they are confident in their ability to find another job, so a declining quits rate can be concerning as it might reflect lower enthusiasm from job seekers.\u00a0 After rising dramatically during the so-called \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d that characterized 2021 and 2022, the quits rate began a steady descent in line with the pullback in hiring and job openings. In September, the quits rate reached its lowest ratio since July 2015, at 1.9% (spring 2020 once again excluded) before bouncing back slightly to 2.1% in October. While some of the recent decline in quits may reflect some level of content among workers after reshuffling a few years ago, it\u2019s likely that the pullback in job postings \u2014 especially in knowledge work sectors like tech \u2014 is weighing on job seekers\u2019 confidence as we head into 2025. To reverse this trend, we would ideally see job openings/postings pick up in roles with fewer opportunities than in 2020, including software development (-33% fewer postings than February 2020), marketing (-24%), and media & communications (-26%).\n\nA line graph titled \u201cThe quits rate is below its pre-pandemic level.\u201d The graph covers data from January 2019 to October 2024. The most recent data show the quits rate is below where it was in 2019.\nUnemployment and layoffs remain low\nBut the outlook for job seekers and workers is not all bad, according to recent unemployment and layoff statistics. Despite a handful of public layoff announcements \u2014 particularly in the tech industry \u2014 overall layoffs remain subdued. In October, the layoff rate clocked in at 1.0%,\u00a0a tenth of a point below the pre-pandemic all-time low.\nWhile unemployment crept up in 2024 \u2014 from 3.7% in January to a high of 4.3% in July \u2014 much of that increase was the result of new and returning entrants into the labor force; a sign that while the market remains strong enough to continue to draw people in, it is no longer strong enough to get those new entrants a job as quickly as a few years ago.\nSince peaking, the unemployment rate has decreased slightly to 4.2% \u2014\u00a0a rate largely on par with healthy pre-pandemic levels. Unlike other indicators, the unemployment rate has a little wiggle room and could tick up a bit without immediately jeopardizing a soft landing in 2025 \u2014\u00a0especially if more labor market entrants drive the rise, as they did in 2024. Even an increase in unemployment to around 4.5% would keep the rate in a historically low range. However, things could get more concerning if there is a sustained increase in the number of permanent job losers, and/or if the unemployment rate rapidly rises from the low 4% range to the high 4% range.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cThe unemployment rate ticked up in 2024.\u201d It covers data from January 2019 to November 2024. The most recent data show that the unemployment rate is above its 2019 average, but still historically low.\nThe economy is well-positioned to handle headwinds heading into 2025\nWhen combined, the current labor market and economic data present a mixed picture. Signs of cooling \u2014 including the decline in job postings, slower hiring rates, and a pullback in quits \u2014 suggest that the labor market is approaching concerning territory. Key sectors like health care, government, and leisure and hospitality, which have supported much of the job growth, may face headwinds as we move into 2025 and beyond.\nHowever, these worrisome trends exist alongside several indicators of resilience, including robust GDP growth and consumer spending. Job postings remain above pre-pandemic levels, unemployment remains low, and wage growth continues to outpace inflation. The Federal Reserve\u2019s recent rate cuts show that policymakers are throwing more support behind the labor market, with more cuts expected in 2025. For now, these macroeconomic indicators lean toward continued labor market resilience and the possibility of a soft landing, rather than a sharp downturn. Despite the uncertainty of a new presidential administration and some signs of economic and demographic headwinds on the horizon, the economy appears well-positioned to navigate 2025.\nDemand for workers has cooled but remains above pre-pandemic levels in many sectors\n2024 proved to be a year of moderation for job postings. After declining consistently since early 2022, the US Job Postings Index (JPI) showed signs of stabilization over the summer, hovering in a tight range between 10% and 13% above pre-pandemic norms for several months. As of November 29, the JPI was 10.1% below its level from the same time last year, but just over 10% above pre-pandemic levels.\nWhat the labor market holds for employer demand in 2025 is quite uncertain. However, there is hope that the almost three-year labor market slowdown could be nearing its end. Job postings held mostly flat through the second half of 2024, and the recent flattening could prove to be a trough that precedes a consistent uptick in postings in 2025. That said, further slowing in the labor market on par with the consistent cooling observed through much of 2023 and the first half of this year could pull job postings below their pre-pandemic level and could be indicative of an economy seriously flirting with a recession.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cJob postings remain 10.2% above the pre-pandemic baseline.\u201d It covers data from February 1, 2020, to November 29, 2024. The most recent data show the Indeed Job Posting Index above its pre-pandemic level despite steady cooling in recent years.\nThe decline in job postings over the past year is relatively broad-based. Of the 52 total job categories regularly tracked by Indeed, only 7 notched a year-over-year gain in postings as of November 29. Most categories across the labor market are in decline, with Pharmacy, Production & Manufacturing, and Industrial Engineering leading the way, all with annual declines exceeding 20%. The lack of healthcare job categories as a bright spot in the labor market is a bit of a departure. Throughout most of the labor market slowdown, healthcare categories \u2014 including Physicians & Surgeons and Therapy \u2014 were still adding job postings, albeit at a rather slow pace.\n\nA table titled \u201cLargest gains and declines in job postings\u201d shows the year-over-year change in the Job Postings Index for different occupational sectors. The most significant decline is for Pharmacy job postings, down 28.1% from last year.\nLabor supply challenges: Aging, participation trends, and immigration\nOne of the most significant headwinds to the labor market heading into 2025 and beyond is an aging population and labor supply that may be reaching its ceiling. After rising rapidly in 2022 and 2023, labor force growth slowed in 2024 to a monthly average gain of 76,000 workers \u2014 well below the strong numbers of previous years and the pre-pandemic average of 136,000. Strong labor force growth (especially among workers aged 25-to-54) has been a major enabler of the resilient post-Covid job market, so this drop is concerning for future job gains as it may be a sign that the labor supply is reaching its limits. After all, it is hard to create a job when you can\u2019t find someone to fill it.\n\nA bar chart titled \u201cLabor force growth has dropped off in 2024\u201d shows data for the first eleven months of each year and includes 2024 (an average of 76,000 per month), 2023 (284,000), 2022 (183,000), and 2021 (136,000). It also shows a line for the average pace from 2017 through 2019: 135,000 per month.\nMore people being drawn into (or back into) the labor force led to a gradual upward movement in the overall participation rate between 2021 and early 2023. However, that upward trend has moved mostly sideways over the past 18 months. Despite minor variations in the monthly data, the overall labor force participation rate (including all potential workers over 16 years old) has hovered around 62.5% since March 2023 \u2014 well short of its all-time high of 67.3% in April 2000.\nAt the same time, labor force participation for those between the ages of 25-54 (or \u201cprime-age\u201d workers, according to federal data sources) continued its upward trend in 2024, rising from 83.2% in January to a peak of 83.9% in September. While short of its 2000 high of 84.5%, prime-age participation is still high and near levels last seen decades ago. Despite near multi-decade participation highs for these workers, it hasn\u2019t been enough to overcome the pull of an aging population, hence the flattening participation rates across all age groups.\n\nA line chart titled \u201cPrime-age labor force participation is at a multidecade high\u201d covers data from January 1998 to November 2024. The chart shows the percentage of 25-54-year-olds employed or unemployed (and actively looking for work) as a share of the total population. Prime-age participation has roared back to multidecade highs despite falling during the pandemic.\nThis rise in prime-age participation has been partly driven by a surge of immigration in recent years, and 2024 was no exception. Between November 2022 and November 2023, foreign-born workers accounted for about 25% of labor force growth. Over the past year (November 2023-November 2024), the foreign-born labor force grew by an estimated 765,000 people, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over the same period, the size of the US-born labor force declined by more than 500,000 and has shrunk year-over-year in every month since May 2024.\nLooking ahead to 2025, it is unlikely that we will continue to see increasing immigration growth due to expected government policy and a return to pre-pandemic trends. If implemented, the incoming presidential administration\u2019s promises of mass deportations and closure of the southern border are likely to impact the flow of immigrants in the coming years. Even without policy changes, the Congressional Budget Office projects that net immigration will fall from an estimated 3.3 million in 2024 to 1.1 million by 2027 \u2014\u00a0a return to pre-pandemic trends.\nInterest in US job postings from abroad also shows signs of leveling off after a post-COVID spike. For years, Indeed has tracked the share of clicks on US job postings from outside the country. In September 2024, 4.3% of all clicks on US postings came from abroad \u2014 roughly double the pre-pandemic level of around 2%. However, foreign interest has mostly plateaued since 2023. If interest from job seekers outside the US is any indication, immigration is unlikely to accelerate next year and boost the labor force.\n\nA line chart titled \u201cForeign job seeker interest is rising, but at a slowing pace\u201d covers data from January 2020 to September 2024. The chart shows that foreign interest in US jobs has risen over time, but the pace has slowed in the last year.\nThe combination of slowing labor force growth, flattening participation rates, and an expected decline in immigration suggests that the labor supply will weigh heavily on the job market in the coming years. With fewer workers to fill job openings, competition is likely to increase in the long run. But what does the competitive landscape look like in 2025?\nCompensation and talent attraction: What job seekers can expect in 2025\nFor job seekers, landing a job today is likely noticeably more difficult and time-consuming than it was in 2022, when competition for top talent was red hot. But employers hoping to fill open roles are probably having a much easier time doing so in 2024. With many indicators of labor market competitiveness and compensation now leveling off, it\u2019s likely that hiring in 2025 will look much like the latter half of 2024: Steady overall, but with some rockiness for individual sectors.\nWage growth is slowing\nAverage hourly wage growth has slowed for most workers, and posted wage growth has settled at a solid year-over-year pace of 3.2%, down significantly from a recent peak of 9.4% in late 2021 but still above pre-pandemic norms. This slowdown should be welcomed as a sign of stability after years of unsustainable growth that contributed to inflation and other volatility, and is a sign of healthier, more-balanced competition among employers. Posted wage growth is now outpacing the rate of inflation, resulting in real wage gains for many workers despite the overall slowdown in wage growth. If the pace of inflation continues to fall towards the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred target of 2%, and wage growth itself stays stable at or near current levels, real wages are likely to continue increasing for many workers.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cInflation is trending down while posted wage growth stabilizes\u201d with a vertical axis from 2.5% to 7.5%. The graph covers from January 2019 to October 2024. It shows posted wage growth with the blue line and inflation with the pink line. Posted wages are now outpacing inflation.\nPosted wage growth has stabilized across low-, middle-, and high-paying jobs. Annual posted wage growth has been holding steady for the lower and middle segments of the market, but wages for all three segments are now growing at a similar annual pace, as wage growth for high-wage sectors recovered in October. Pent-up demand for post-pandemic spending still has some gas left in the tank, bolstering lower-wage sectors \u2014 including retail and food services \u2014 but high-wage sectors are catching up.\n\nA line chart titled \u201cWage growth is stabilizing across sectors\u201d covering data from March 2019 to October 2024. The chart shows year-over-year wage growth for low-, middle-, and high-wage sectors. Low-wage roles peaked at 11.5% in 2022 but have since declined to 3.3%. Middle-wage roles peaked at 8.6%, now at 3.4%, and high-wage roles peaked at 7.6%, now at 3.5%. The chart suggests wage growth is stabilizing after the post-pandemic surge, with higher-wage roles showing signs of a rebound.\nPay transparency continues to rise, but the pace has slowed\nSalary transparency is increasingly becoming a common feature in job postings, especially as more states pass legislation requiring it. Including pay information in job postings can help lead to faster hires as job seekers can immediately determine if a given wage is acceptable to them, and employers can have a set range when it comes time for negotiations. Transparency can also help close gender, racial, or other pay gaps in the workforce, ensuring everyone is playing on a level field. Salary transparency continued to grow overall in 2024, though at a slower pace than in prior years. Still, some sectors and states remain more opaque than others when it comes to disclosing pay information.\nAs of September 2024, 57.8% of job postings on Indeed listed some type of pay information, up from 52.2% in September 2023. From September 2022 to September 2023, the percentage of job postings advertising salary information climbed 15.7 percentage points.\nThe cooling demand for workers over the past several years could be a factor in the slowing growth in salary transparency, as employers may feel less of a push to attract talent with clear communication on pay. However, if the labor market begins to heat up again in 2025, then salary transparency is likely to increase at a steady clip, as employers compete for talent.\n\nA line chart titled \u201cPay transparency still climbing despite losing some momentum\u201d covers data from January 2019 to September 2024. The chart shows a line moving steadily upward and to the right with a value of 58% labeled in September 2024.\u00a0\nEmployer mentions of benefits in job postings have leveled off after years of growth\nBenefits are another form of compensation, including paid time off, 401(k) contributions, or even gym and fitness reimbursements. As of October 2024, 61% of postings noted at least one benefit, up from less than 40% during the depths of the pandemic in the second half of 2020. The inclusion of benefits in job postings has been most common in low-wage roles \u2014 roles where job seekers may expect fewer benefits, and employers may be more likely to mention benefits to attract applicants in a tight labor market. In some higher-paying roles, job seekers may assume that a handful of standard benefits, including paid time off, sick leave, and/or retirement benefits, are likely to be offered, and so employers may not overtly include these common benefits in their job postings for these higher-paying roles.\nOverall, the share of postings advertising a benefit rose sharply from 2021 through late 2023/early 2024 as employers struggled to fill open jobs, before plateauing and ticking down in recent months. In 2025, we expect this share will likely even out between 55% and 60%.\n\nA line chart titled \u201cThe share of job postings with benefits has moderated\u201d covers data from January 2019 to October 2024. The chart shows the share of total postings advertising at least one benefit. The share of postings advertising a benefit rose sharply in 2020 but are now slowing down.\nRemote work opportunities are declining but remain well above pre-pandemic levels\nRemote work options also became popular in a number of sectors during the pandemic, both for public health reasons and as a means for employers to attract talent and stand out from the crowd in a competitive landscape. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 23.8% of employees teleworked at some point in the month of October 2024, up four percentage points year-over-year.\u00a0 But while the overall share of job postings that mention remote work options remains high relative to pre-pandemic norms and more employees are participating in telework than the year before, the share of postings advertising remote opportunities has fallen from its 2022 peak, both overall and in most sectors. This holds true even in more traditionally remote-friendly sectors like tech.\nMuch of the initial downturn in remote work opportunities can be attributed to a broad decline in postings overall for the jobs typically more likely to offer remote work. If the mix of jobs today was the same as in 2022, the total share of remote postings would have remained at or near 2022 peak levels well into 2024. In the last few months, however, the share of remote postings has begun to drop, regardless of the job mix.\nThis downward trend may very well continue into 2025, but remote work overall is unlikely to return to 2019 levels. The companies that offered remote work largely as a perk to remain competitive or only as an operational necessity during the pandemic may continue to implement sweeping return-to-office policies or switch to a more hybrid approach. But those firms that have embraced remote work wholeheartedly will likely continue doing so.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cRemote postings decline regardless of job mix\u201d covers data from February 2019 to October 2024. With a vertical axis ranging from 0% to 10%, Indeed tracked the share of all postings on the US Indeed platform that contained terms related to remote work, as seen with the blue line. The pink line tracked the same trend but held the occupation mix constant to February 5, 2022. Recently, both the actual and fixed data are trending downward.\nWage growth is stabilizing and salary transparency is higher than in years prior \u2014 good for employers and job seekers alike. Other forms of compensation, including the share of jobs offering benefits and/or remote work, are ticking down but remain above recent norms. All of this suggests that the much-needed cooldown that began in 2023 and continued into 2024 (after a few years of unsustainable heat) was largely successful in helping to steady the ship. In the long term, labor shortages may yet bring the labor market temperature back to boiling, but the current cooler climate, however temporary, is a welcome one. That being said, it isn\u2019t yet entirely smooth sailing. If these and other indicators used to measure labor market competitiveness start faltering and sending signals that employers no longer need to compete as stridently for talent, it could mean rocky waters are approaching.\nGenAI is growing, but needs widespread adoption for a strong economic impact\nThe data around sluggish (at best) population growth and an uncertain future supply of human workers are stark. But recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and especially generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) \u2014 tools that can generate remarkably human-like text, audio, and images, and that can parse large amounts of data in seconds \u2014 offer some hope that the tools may soon be able to pick up some of the slack. While GenAI is unlikely to replace workers anytime soon, it has the potential to boost the productivity of individual workers, which may be especially needed in coming years.\nThe share of jobs either developing or overtly using GenAI tools is small\u00a0(only about 2 in 1,000 jobs nationwide mentioned any of a basket of GenAI-related terms as of the end of October),\u00a0but growing rapidly. But to realize the full potential of the tools, AI & GenAI adoption will need to become far more widespread across the economy as a whole,\u00a0not just in high-tech sectors that have a history of quickly adopting (and building) new digital technologies.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cGenAI job postings are rare but growing.\u201d With a vertical axis ranging from 0.00 to 0.3, and a horizontal axis ranging from January 2020 to October 2024, the graph shows the percentage of job postings containing GenAI terms, and the recent rise of that percentage.\nGenAI tools have many benefits, but they also often come with substantial upfront costs to both implement the tools and train staff on their use. Currently, the majority of sectors with the highest share of postings mentioning GenAI are also those known for creating and implementing new tech and most likely to be involved in developing GenAI tools themselves, including mathematics and software development. At the same time, some sectors that could really benefit from GenAI use \u2014including the insurance and medical information fields \u2014 where GenAI has the potential to perform a high share of skills and tasks at a relatively high level, have been slow to adopt the technology.\n\nBar graph titled \u201cShare of postings mentioning GenAI by sector.\u201d With a horizontal axis ranging from 0.00 to 6, the graph shows the percentage of job postings containing GenAI terms by sector, for sectors with GenAI-related postings greater than 0.09%. Share is based on the average number of postings in October 2024.\nAdoption of GenAI tools, and development of the tools themselves, is very likely to continue growing in 2025, but the overall share of GenAI-related postings will remain low if adoption isn\u2019t more widespread throughout sectors.\nThe decline in experience and tenure requirements hints at a more flexible hiring future\nWhile AI and GenAI tools continue to improve their ability to learn human skills, they are nowhere near close to being able to fully replace a skilled human. As labor shortages deepen, many employers are turning to skills-first hiring practices intended to bring in candidates who can show they can perform the tasks associated with a given role\u2014regardless of their formal training or level of experience.\nThe share of job postings requiring at least a bachelor\u2019s degree fell to 17.6% in October 2024, from roughly 20% prior to the pandemic. This may seem like a modest decline on the surface, but in reality, it represents tens of thousands more jobs potentially open today compared to a few years ago for the more than 60% of Americans without a college degree. A tight labor market, in which demand for workers exceeded supply, likely contributed to the opening of previously walled-off job opportunities. Likewise, a rebalancing of the labor market as demand for workers continued to cool in 2024 likely contributed to a leveling off in the share of job postings requiring at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in the second half of the year.\n\nA line chart titled \u201cEmployers are becoming less likely to include college degree requirements in job postings\u201d covers data from January 2019 to October 2024. The chart shows the overall share of jobs asking for a bachelor\u2019s degree or above falling in recent years.\nThe trend in years\u2019 experience requirements is similar, as the share of job postings with a specific experience requirement has fallen in recent years, from 40% in October 2022 to 32.6% in October 2024, after flattening over much of the previous year. If the labor market picks up in 2025, then the share of job postings requiring a college degree or particular years of experience could begin falling again as employers compete for workers.\n\nA line chart titled \u201cFewer job postings are listing desired years of experience\u201d covers data from January 2022 to October 2024. The chart shows the overall share of jobs asking for experience requirements has fallen in recent years.\nConclusion\nAfter navigating significant turbulence in recent years, including elevated inflation and widespread recession fears, the US economy appears well-positioned to make a soft landing in 2025. But the wheels aren\u2019t on the ground yet. While the current speed and direction of the economy are providing significant momentum, further slowdowns in hiring and labor supply growth may prove more difficult to navigate. The degree to which these headwinds drag on the economy will depend on how policymakers choose to pilot the plane and what policy objectives they pursue next year.\nFor job seekers and employers, 2025 is shaping up to look a lot like the second half of 2024: Neither too hot nor too cold, but somewhere in a lukewarm middle. Absent a meaningful uptick in job openings and postings, finding a job could be trickier in 2025 than it was during the hiring surge of 2021 and 2022, especially in knowledge-work sectors (including software development, marketing, and media & communications) where employer demand remains low. Still, there are plenty of pockets of opportunity for job seekers, and competition for workers is likely to stay strong for employers in heavily in-person and/or lower-paying sectors where job postings remain well above pre-pandemic levels.\nProviding healthy wages, embracing pay transparency, expanding benefit offerings, and adopting skills-based hiring practices where possible will give employers additional tools to attract workers, at least in the short term. In the longer term, the labor market is at the beginning stages of a race between the challenges posed by deteriorating demographics and an aging workforce on one side, and the promise of AI tools to boost productivity and unleash innovation on the other. If the tools live up to their potential and adoption increases, they could help cover some emerging labor shortages and allow human workers to focus on more productive work. But if adoption does not increase and/or the tools prove too costly or cumbersome to implement at a wide scale, those emerging labor shortages may yet lead to more volatility and stagnating growth. The next year, and the years beyond, will shed more critical light on the state of this race.\nSubscribe to Indeed Hiring Lab\nThe latest insights on hiring and the economy, delivered straight to your inbox\nEmail* :\nThis is a carousel with 3 slides.

Posted wage growth slowed to a strong but sustainable pace, and hiring employers\u2019 use of benefits, pay transparency, and skills-based hiring processes grew to attract workers.\nNow, after several years of speculation and unrealized recession fears, the runway for an elusive economic soft landing \u2014 in which economic activity and inflation cool to more sustainable levels without widespread job losses or other adverse economic impacts \u2014 is finally coming into view for 2025. As the labor market makes its approach, it will be essential to monitor the economy\u2019s heading, altitude, and speed to determine whether we maintain a smooth glide path, run into turbulence, land hard, or even blow past the runway in a no-landing scenario in which economic activity and inflation drastically re-accelerate. The labor market has been softening, but, over the past few years, has largely done so from a position of strength. That strength represented a cushion against mounting headwinds, but that cushion has now largely faded, and the margin for error is narrower today than it has been at any point in recent memory.\nAs we enter 2025, several data points and trends will tell us where we are in relation to the ground and how far we\u2019ve got to go. Here is what to expect if you\u2019re expecting a soft landing in 2025:\n\nHiring and quitting cannot fall, and unemployment and layoffs cannot rise: After declining to their lowest levels in a decade, hiring and quitting need to stop falling and start stabilizing \u2014 or better yet, gradually improve \u2014 in order to avoid a rough landing. At the same time, unemployment and layoffs need to remain at or near their current low levels.\nA pickup in job growth will depend on a pickup in job openings: Employer demand (job openings/postings) and monthly payroll gains will also need to stabilize or begin picking up. Substantial declines below pre-pandemic levels could signal a broader economic slowdown.\nEmployers must figure out how to do more with less: The US will have to find a way to overcome the short and long-term impacts of a dwindling labor supply as the population ages and immigration returns to pre-pandemic trends.\u00a0\nWage growth and inflation must strike a tricky balance: Wage growth needs to stabilize at or near current levels to preserve real income gains for workers. However, looming labor shortages may force employers to pay workers more than anticipated, which could push up prices and reignite inflation. Right now, the market is broadly balanced between the two, but maintaining that balance may be difficult.\nAI & GenAI tools start to meaningfully boost worker productivity: Growing generative AI adoption could serve as a critical productivity booster and may offset some labor shortage effects, particularly in industries slow to embrace innovation.\nEmployers must continue to embrace flexibility: A growing focus on reducing degree and experience requirements, and boosting skills-based hiring practices, may provide another path to address labor supply challenges.\n\nThis report will examine these trends, including the current path and potential headwinds or tailwinds each one may face in 2025.\nThe US economy is solid, but there\u2019s little room for continued softening in 2025\nThings are looking decent for the US economy heading into 2025. The labor market continued to cool this year, but unemployment and layoffs remained reassuringly low. Wage growth exceeded the rate of inflation for much of the year as inflation continued to retreat, leading to increased real spending power for many workers. Real GDP growth clocked in around 3% over the last two quarters, and consumer spending data remains solid. But are these otherwise respectable data points just the silver lining for mounting storm clouds?\nOne of the clearest indications of a cooling labor market has been the ongoing pullback in job postings from their March 2022 peak. As of November 2024, the Indeed Job Posting Index was down 10% over the year, though still 10% above pre-pandemic levels. Federal job openings data reflect a similar trend, with official openings standing 11% above February 2020 levels on the last business day of October, despite cooling from last year. While these data reflect continued employer demand and resilience in the labor market, we are approaching a point where further cooling may begin to translate into rising unemployment.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cUS job openings and postings track each other\u201d with a vertical axis from 60 to 150. The graph covers from January 31, 2020, to November 29, 2024. It shows that the Indeed Job Posting Index (blue line) tends to move similarly to federal JOLTS data (pink line).\nJob gains are slowing in key industries\nAnother sign of labor market softening has been slowing job gains. In 2023, the economy added an average of 251,000 jobs per month, well above the pre-pandemic pace of 166,000. That average has fallen to 180,000 jobs through the first eleven months of 2024 \u2014\u00a0which is above the roughly 100,000/month pace needed to keep up with population growth, but well below previous years\u2019 clips. To achieve a soft landing in 2025, payroll gains must continue to be robust enough to keep up with population growth to meet the Federal Reserve\u2019s goal of full employment.\n\nA bar chart titled \u201cMonthly job gains are declining.\u201d The chart shows data from January 2021 to November 2024. The 3-month average monthly change in nonfarm payroll growth has slowed dramatically in recent years, but remains above the pace needed to keep up with population growth.\nA smooth landing will also likely require more broad-based job gains next year. In addition to the slowing overall pace of job creation, those jobs that have been added in 2024 have been primarily concentrated in just three industries: health care & social assistance, government, and leisure & hospitality, which combined represented almost 75% of all jobs added in the last 12 months. Already somewhat concerning, this concentration could become even more worrisome in 2025 if these industries run out of steam \u2014 and there are some indications that they are.\nThe leisure and hospitality sector added an average of 47,000 jobs per month in the first eleven months of 2023, but just 23,000 per month in the first 11 months of this year. Average monthly gains in government employment have also dropped in 2024, from 58,000 to 38,000, and government hiring is likely to continue to fall in 2025 if President-elect Trump follows through on campaign promises to eliminate many government positions. Job gains in health care & social assistance this year have been roughly the same as in 2023, but openings and hiring rates in the industry have softened from previous years, a potential sign of fewer job gains to come.\nHires and quits are near decade-lows\nThe pullback in hiring has been even more pronounced among other industries. As of October, hires rates were below pre-pandemic (February 2020) levels in 9 of the 13 major industries defined by the federal government. The information (tech) and construction industries have experienced the largest drop in hires rates, with the rate in each currently below pre-pandemic levels by a percentage point or more. Despite a slight pickup in recent months, slower industry hiring in 2024 has led to the lowest overall hires rate since 2013 (excluding March/April 2020 due to pandemic distortions).\nThe hires rate fell to a recent low of 3.3% over the summer, bounced back to 3.5% in September, then returned to 3.3% in October. Looking ahead, hiring in 2025 will likely remain lower than in past years, but the recent upward trend is an encouraging sign that things might be picking back up. To stay on the glide path toward a soft landing, we would ideally see the rate gradually climb back toward or even match its 2019 average of 3.9%. Sideways movement or slow gains are acceptable for now, but an extended decline below current levels could risk stalling the plane before arrival.\n\nA chart titled \u201cHires rate by US industry sector\u201d shows the hires rate for various industry sectors in September 2024 and February 2020. With a few exceptions, most sectors had a hires rate in September below their pre-pandemic rate.\u00a0\nLike hiring, quits are a good indicator of labor market dynamics and job seeker confidence. Workers tend to feel more comfortable quitting when they are confident in their ability to find another job, so a declining quits rate can be concerning as it might reflect lower enthusiasm from job seekers.\u00a0 After rising dramatically during the so-called \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d that characterized 2021 and 2022, the quits rate began a steady descent in line with the pullback in hiring and job openings. In September, the quits rate reached its lowest ratio since July 2015, at 1.9% (spring 2020 once again excluded) before bouncing back slightly to 2.1% in October. While some of the recent decline in quits may reflect some level of content among workers after reshuffling a few years ago, it\u2019s likely that the pullback in job postings \u2014 especially in knowledge work sectors like tech \u2014 is weighing on job seekers\u2019 confidence as we head into 2025. To reverse this trend, we would ideally see job openings/postings pick up in roles with fewer opportunities than in 2020, including software development (-33% fewer postings than February 2020), marketing (-24%), and media & communications (-26%).\n\nA line graph titled \u201cThe quits rate is below its pre-pandemic level.\u201d The graph covers data from January 2019 to October 2024. The most recent data show the quits rate is below where it was in 2019.\nUnemployment and layoffs remain low\nBut the outlook for job seekers and workers is not all bad, according to recent unemployment and layoff statistics. Despite a handful of public layoff announcements \u2014 particularly in the tech industry \u2014 overall layoffs remain subdued. In October, the layoff rate clocked in at 1.0%,\u00a0a tenth of a point below the pre-pandemic all-time low.\nWhile unemployment crept up in 2024 \u2014 from 3.7% in January to a high of 4.3% in July \u2014 much of that increase was the result of new and returning entrants into the labor force; a sign that while the market remains strong enough to continue to draw people in, it is no longer strong enough to get those new entrants a job as quickly as a few years ago.\nSince peaking, the unemployment rate has decreased slightly to 4.2% \u2014\u00a0a rate largely on par with healthy pre-pandemic levels. Unlike other indicators, the unemployment rate has a little wiggle room and could tick up a bit without immediately jeopardizing a soft landing in 2025 \u2014\u00a0especially if more labor market entrants drive the rise, as they did in 2024. Even an increase in unemployment to around 4.5% would keep the rate in a historically low range. However, things could get more concerning if there is a sustained increase in the number of permanent job losers, and/or if the unemployment rate rapidly rises from the low 4% range to the high 4% range.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cThe unemployment rate ticked up in 2024.\u201d It covers data from January 2019 to November 2024. The most recent data show that the unemployment rate is above its 2019 average, but still historically low.\nThe economy is well-positioned to handle headwinds heading into 2025\nWhen combined, the current labor market and economic data present a mixed picture. Signs of cooling \u2014 including the decline in job postings, slower hiring rates, and a pullback in quits \u2014 suggest that the labor market is approaching concerning territory. Key sectors like health care, government, and leisure and hospitality, which have supported much of the job growth, may face headwinds as we move into 2025 and beyond.\nHowever, these worrisome trends exist alongside several indicators of resilience, including robust GDP growth and consumer spending. Job postings remain above pre-pandemic levels, unemployment remains low, and wage growth continues to outpace inflation. The Federal Reserve\u2019s recent rate cuts show that policymakers are throwing more support behind the labor market, with more cuts expected in 2025. For now, these macroeconomic indicators lean toward continued labor market resilience and the possibility of a soft landing, rather than a sharp downturn. Despite the uncertainty of a new presidential administration and some signs of economic and demographic headwinds on the horizon, the economy appears well-positioned to navigate 2025.\nDemand for workers has cooled but remains above pre-pandemic levels in many sectors\n2024 proved to be a year of moderation for job postings. After declining consistently since early 2022, the US Job Postings Index (JPI) showed signs of stabilization over the summer, hovering in a tight range between 10% and 13% above pre-pandemic norms for several months. As of November 29, the JPI was 10.1% below its level from the same time last year, but just over 10% above pre-pandemic levels.\nWhat the labor market holds for employer demand in 2025 is quite uncertain. However, there is hope that the almost three-year labor market slowdown could be nearing its end. Job postings held mostly flat through the second half of 2024, and the recent flattening could prove to be a trough that precedes a consistent uptick in postings in 2025. That said, further slowing in the labor market on par with the consistent cooling observed through much of 2023 and the first half of this year could pull job postings below their pre-pandemic level and could be indicative of an economy seriously flirting with a recession.\n\nA line graph titled \u201cJob postings remain 10.2% above the pre-pandemic baseline.\u201d It covers data from February 1, 2020, to November 29, 2024. The most recent data show the Indeed Job Posting Index above its pre-pandemic level despite steady cooling in recent years.\nThe decline in job postings over the past year is relatively broad-based. Of the 52 total job categories regularly tracked by Indeed, only 7 notched a year-over-year gain in postings as of November 29. Most categories across the labor market are in decline, with Pharmacy, Production & Manufacturing, and Industrial Engineering leading the way, all with annual declines exceeding 20%. The lack of healthcare job categories as a bright spot in the labor market is a bit of a departure. Throughout most of the labor market slowdown, healthcare categories \u2014 including Physicians & Surgeons and Therapy \u2014 were still adding job postings, albeit at a rather slow pace.\n\nA table titled \u201cLargest gains and declines in job postings\u201d shows the year-over-year change in the Job Postings Index for different occupational sectors. The most significant decline is for Pharmacy job postings, down 28.1% from last year.\nLabor supply challenges: Aging, participation trends, and immigration\nOne of the most significant headwinds to the labor market heading into 2025 and beyond is an aging population and labor supply that may be reaching its ceiling. After rising rapidly in 2022 and 2023, labor force growth slowed in 2024 to a monthly average gain of 76,000 workers \u2014 well below the strong numbers of previous years and the pre-pandemic average of 136,000. Strong labor force growth (especially among workers aged 25-to-54) has been a major enabler of the resilient post-Covid job market, so this drop is concerning for future job gains as it may be a sign that the labor supply is reaching its limits. After all, it is hard to create a job when you can\u2019t find someone to fill it.\n\nA bar chart titled \u201cLabor force growth has dropped off in 2024\u201d shows data for the first eleven months of each year and includes 2024 (an average of 76,000 per month), 2023 (284,000), 2022 (183,000), and 2021 (136,000). It also shows a line for the average pace from 2017 through 2019: 135,000 per month.\nMore people being drawn into (or back into) the labor force led to a gradual upward movement in the overall participation rate between 2021 and early 2023. However, that upward trend has moved mostly sideways over the past 18 months. Despite minor variations in the monthly data, the overall labor force participation rate (including all potential workers over 16 years old) has hovered around 62.5% since March 2023 \u2014 well short of its all-time high of 67.3% in April 2000.\nAt the same time, labor force participation for those between the ages of 25-54 (or \u201cprime-age\u201d workers, according to federal data sources) continued its upward trend in 2024, rising from 83.2% in January to a peak of 83.9% in September. While short of its 2000 high of 84.5%, prime-age participation is still high and near levels last seen decades ago. Despite near multi-decade participation highs for these workers, it hasn\u2019t been enough to overcome the pull of an aging population, hence the flattening participation rates across all age groups.\n\nA line chart titled \u201cPrime-age labor force participation is at a multidecade high\u201d covers data from January 1998 to November 2024. The chart shows the percentage of 25-54-year-olds employed or unemployed (and actively looking for work) as a share of the total population. Prime-age participation has roared back to multidecade highs despite falling during the pandemic.\nThis rise in prime-age participation has been partly driven by a surge of immigration in recent years, and 2024 was no exception. Between November 2022 and November 2023, foreign-born workers accounted for about 25% of labor force growth. Over the past year (November 2023-November 2024), the foreign-born labor force grew by an estimated 765,000 people, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over the same period, the size of the US-born labor force declined by more than 500,000 and has shrunk year-over-year in every month since May 2024.\nLooking ahead to 2025, it is unlikely that we will continue to see increasing immigration growth due to expected government policy and a return to pre-pandemic trends. If implemented, the incoming presidential administration\u2019s promises of mass deportations and closure of the southern border are likely to impact the flow of immigrants in the coming years. Even without policy changes, the Congressional Budget Office projects that net immigration will fall from an estimated 3.3 million in 2024 to 1.1 million by 2027 \u2014\u00a0a return to pre-pandemic trends.\nInterest in US job postings from abroad also shows signs of leveling off after a post-COVID spike. For years, Indeed has tracked the share of clicks on US job postings from outside the country. In September 2024, 4.3% of all clicks on US postings came from abroad \u2014 roughly double the pre-pandemic level of around 2%. However, foreign interest has mostly plateaued since 2023. If interest from job seekers outside the US is any indication, immigration is unlikely to accelerate next year and boost the labor force.\n\nA line chart titled \u201cForeign job seeker interest is rising, but at a slowing pace\u201d covers data from January 2020 to September 2024. The chart shows that foreign interest in US jobs has risen over time, but the pace has slowed in the last year.\nThe combination of slowing labor force growth, flattening participation rates, and an expected decline in immigration suggests that the labor supply will weigh heavily on the job market in the coming years. With fewer workers to fill job openings, competition is likely to increase in the long run. But what does the competitive landscape look like in 2025?\nCompensation and talent attraction: What job seekers can expect in 2025\nFor job seekers, landing a job today is likely noticeably more difficult and time-consuming than it was in 2022, when competition for top talent was red hot. But employers hoping to fill open roles are probably having a much easier time doing so in 2024. With many indicators of labor market competitiveness and compensation now leveling off, it\u2019s likely that hiring in 2025 will look much like the latter half of 2024: Steady overall, but with some rockiness for individual sectors.\nWage growth is slowing\nAverage hourly wage growth has slowed for most workers, and posted wage growth has settled at a solid year-over-year pace of 3.2%, down significantly from a recent peak of 9.4% in late 2021 but still above pre-pandemic norms. This slowdown should be welcomed as a sign of stability after years of unsustainable growth that contributed to inflation and other volatility, and is a sign of healthier, more-balanced competition among employers. Posted wage growth is now outpacing the rate of inflation, resulting in real wage gains for many workers despite the overall slowdown in wage growth. If the pace of inflation continues to fall towards the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred target of 2%, and wage growth itself stays stable at or near current levels, real wages are likely to continue increasing for many workers.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cInflation is trending down while posted wage growth stabilizes\u201d with a vertical axis from 2.5% to 7.5%. The graph covers from January 2019 to October 2024. It shows posted wage growth with the blue line and inflation with the pink line. Posted wages are now outpacing inflation.\nPosted wage growth has stabilized across low-, middle-, and high-paying jobs. Annual posted wage growth has been holding steady for the lower and middle segments of the market, but wages for all three segments are now growing at a similar annual pace, as wage growth for high-wage sectors recovered in October. Pent-up demand for post-pandemic spending still has some gas left in the tank, bolstering lower-wage sectors \u2014 including retail and food services \u2014 but high-wage sectors are catching up.\n\nA line chart titled \u201cWage growth is stabilizing across sectors\u201d covering data from March 2019 to October 2024. The chart shows year-over-year wage growth for low-, middle-, and high-wage sectors. Low-wage roles peaked at 11.5% in 2022 but have since declined to 3.3%. Middle-wage roles peaked at 8.6%, now at 3.4%, and high-wage roles peaked at 7.6%, now at 3.5%. The chart suggests wage growth is stabilizing after the post-pandemic surge, with higher-wage roles showing signs of a rebound.\nPay transparency continues to rise, but the pace has slowed\nSalary transparency is increasingly becoming a common feature in job postings, especially as more states pass legislation requiring it. Including pay information in job postings can help lead to faster hires as job seekers can immediately determine if a given wage is acceptable to them, and employers can have a set range when it comes time for negotiations. Transparency can also help close gender, racial, or other pay gaps in the workforce, ensuring everyone is playing on a level field. Salary transparency continued to grow overall in 2024, though at a slower pace than in prior years. Still, some sectors and states remain more opaque than others when it comes to disclosing pay information.\nAs of September 2024, 57.8% of job postings on Indeed listed some type of pay information, up from 52.2% in September 2023. From September 2022 to September 2023, the percentage of job postings advertising salary information climbed 15.7 percentage points.\nThe cooling demand for workers over the past several years could be a factor in the slowing growth in salary transparency, as employers may feel less of a push to attract talent with clear communication on pay. However, if the labor market begins to heat up again in 2025, then salary transparency is likely to increase at a steady clip, as employers compete for talent.\n\nA line chart titled \u201cPay transparency still climbing despite losing some momentum\u201d covers data from January 2019 to September 2024. The chart shows a line moving steadily upward and to the right with a value of 58% labeled in September 2024.\u00a0\nEmployer mentions of benefits in job postings have leveled off after years of growth\nBenefits are another form of compensation, including paid time off, 401(k) contributions, or even gym and fitness reimbursements. As of October 2024, 61% of postings noted at least one benefit, up from less than 40% during the depths of the pandemic in the second half of 2020. The inclusion of benefits in job postings has been most common in low-wage roles \u2014 roles where job seekers may expect fewer benefits, and employers may be more likely to mention benefits to attract applicants in a tight labor market. In some higher-paying roles, job seekers may assume that a handful of standard benefits, including paid time off, sick leave, and/or retirement benefits, are likely to be offered, and so employers may not overtly include these common benefits in their job postings for these higher-paying roles.\nOverall, the share of postings advertising a benefit rose sharply from 2021 through late 2023/early 2024 as employers struggled to fill open jobs, before plateauing and ticking down in recent months. In 2025, we expect this share will likely even out between 55% and 60%.\n\nA line chart titled \u201cThe share of job postings with benefits has moderated\u201d covers data from January 2019 to October 2024. The chart shows the share of total postings advertising at least one benefit. The share of postings advertising a benefit rose sharply in 2020 but are now slowing down.\nRemote work opportunities are declining but remain well above pre-pandemic levels\nRemote work options also became popular in a number of sectors during the pandemic, both for public health reasons and as a means for employers to attract talent and stand out from the crowd in a competitive landscape. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 23.8% of employees teleworked at some point in the month of October 2024, up four percentage points year-over-year.\u00a0 But while the overall share of job postings that mention remote work options remains high relative to pre-pandemic norms and more employees are participating in telework than the year before, the share of postings advertising remote opportunities has fallen from its 2022 peak, both overall and in most sectors. This holds true even in more traditionally remote-friendly sectors like tech.\nMuch of the initial downturn in remote work opportunities can be attributed to a broad decline in postings overall for the jobs typically more likely to offer remote work. If the mix of jobs today was the same as in 2022, the total share of remote postings would have remained at or near 2022 peak levels well into 2024. In the last few months, however, the share of remote postings has begun to drop, regardless of the job mix.\nThis downward trend may very well continue into 2025, but remote work overall is unlikely to return to 2019 levels. The companies that offered remote work largely as a perk to remain competitive or only as an operational necessity during the pandemic may continue to implement sweeping return-to-office policies or switch to a more hybrid approach. But those firms that have embraced remote work wholeheartedly will likely continue doing so.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cRemote postings decline regardless of job mix\u201d covers data from February 2019 to October 2024. With a vertical axis ranging from 0% to 10%, Indeed tracked the share of all postings on the US Indeed platform that contained terms related to remote work, as seen with the blue line. The pink line tracked the same trend but held the occupation mix constant to February 5, 2022. Recently, both the actual and fixed data are trending downward.\nWage growth is stabilizing and salary transparency is higher than in years prior \u2014 good for employers and job seekers alike. Other forms of compensation, including the share of jobs offering benefits and/or remote work, are ticking down but remain above recent norms. All of this suggests that the much-needed cooldown that began in 2023 and continued into 2024 (after a few years of unsustainable heat) was largely successful in helping to steady the ship. In the long term, labor shortages may yet bring the labor market temperature back to boiling, but the current cooler climate, however temporary, is a welcome one. That being said, it isn\u2019t yet entirely smooth sailing. If these and other indicators used to measure labor market competitiveness start faltering and sending signals that employers no longer need to compete as stridently for talent, it could mean rocky waters are approaching.\nGenAI is growing, but needs widespread adoption for a strong economic impact\nThe data around sluggish (at best) population growth and an uncertain future supply of human workers are stark. But recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and especially generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) \u2014 tools that can generate remarkably human-like text, audio, and images, and that can parse large amounts of data in seconds \u2014 offer some hope that the tools may soon be able to pick up some of the slack. While GenAI is unlikely to replace workers anytime soon, it has the potential to boost the productivity of individual workers, which may be especially needed in coming years.\nThe share of jobs either developing or overtly using GenAI tools is small\u00a0(only about 2 in 1,000 jobs nationwide mentioned any of a basket of GenAI-related terms as of the end of October),\u00a0but growing rapidly. But to realize the full potential of the tools, AI & GenAI adoption will need to become far more widespread across the economy as a whole,\u00a0not just in high-tech sectors that have a history of quickly adopting (and building) new digital technologies.\n\nLine graph titled \u201cGenAI job postings are rare but growing.\u201d With a vertical axis ranging from 0.00 to 0.3, and a horizontal axis ranging from January 2020 to October 2024, the graph shows the percentage of job postings containing GenAI terms, and the recent rise of that percentage.\nGenAI tools have many benefits, but they also often come with substantial upfront costs to both implement the tools and train staff on their use. Currently, the majority of sectors with the highest share of postings mentioning GenAI are also those known for creating and implementing new tech and most likely to be involved in developing GenAI tools themselves, including mathematics and software development. At the same time, some sectors that could really benefit from GenAI use \u2014including the insurance and medical information fields \u2014 where GenAI has the potential to perform a high share of skills and tasks at a relatively high level, have been slow to adopt the technology.\n\nBar graph titled \u201cShare of postings mentioning GenAI by sector.\u201d With a horizontal axis ranging from 0.00 to 6, the graph shows the percentage of job postings containing GenAI terms by sector, for sectors with GenAI-related postings greater than 0.09%. Share is based on the average number of postings in October 2024.\nAdoption of GenAI tools, and development of the tools themselves, is very likely to continue growing in 2025, but the overall share of GenAI-related postings will remain low if adoption isn\u2019t more widespread throughout sectors.\nThe decline in experience and tenure requirements hints at a more flexible hiring future\nWhile AI and GenAI tools continue to improve their ability to learn human skills, they are nowhere near close to being able to fully replace a skilled human. As labor shortages deepen, many employers are turning to skills-first hiring practices intended to bring in candidates who can show they can perform the tasks associated with a given role\u2014regardless of their formal training or level of experience.\nThe share of job postings requiring at least a bachelor\u2019s degree fell to 17.6% in October 2024, from roughly 20% prior to the pandemic. This may seem like a modest decline on the surface, but in reality, it represents tens of thousands more jobs potentially open today compared to a few years ago for the more than 60% of Americans without a college degree. A tight labor market, in which demand for workers exceeded supply, likely contributed to the opening of previously walled-off job opportunities. Likewise, a rebalancing of the labor market as demand for workers continued to cool in 2024 likely contributed to a leveling off in the share of job postings requiring at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in the second half of the year.\n\nA line chart titled \u201cEmployers are becoming less likely to include college degree requirements in job postings\u201d covers data from January 2019 to October 2024. The chart shows the overall share of jobs asking for a bachelor\u2019s degree or above falling in recent years.\nThe trend in years\u2019 experience requirements is similar, as the share of job postings with a specific experience requirement has fallen in recent years, from 40% in October 2022 to 32.6% in October 2024, after flattening over much of the previous year. If the labor market picks up in 2025, then the share of job postings requiring a college degree or particular years of experience could begin falling again as employers compete for workers.\n\nA line chart titled \u201cFewer job postings are listing desired years of experience\u201d covers data from January 2022 to October 2024. The chart shows the overall share of jobs asking for experience requirements has fallen in recent years.\nConclusion\nAfter navigating significant turbulence in recent years, including elevated inflation and widespread recession fears, the US economy appears well-positioned to make a soft landing in 2025. But the wheels aren\u2019t on the ground yet. While the current speed and direction of the economy are providing significant momentum, further slowdowns in hiring and labor supply growth may prove more difficult to navigate. The degree to which these headwinds drag on the economy will depend on how policymakers choose to pilot the plane and what policy objectives they pursue next year.\nFor job seekers and employers, 2025 is shaping up to look a lot like the second half of 2024: Neither too hot nor too cold, but somewhere in a lukewarm middle. Absent a meaningful uptick in job openings and postings, finding a job could be trickier in 2025 than it was during the hiring surge of 2021 and 2022, especially in knowledge-work sectors (including software development, marketing, and media & communications) where employer demand remains low. Still, there are plenty of pockets of opportunity for job seekers, and competition for workers is likely to stay strong for employers in heavily in-person and/or lower-paying sectors where job postings remain well above pre-pandemic levels.\nProviding healthy wages, embracing pay transparency, expanding benefit offerings, and adopting skills-based hiring practices where possible will give employers additional tools to attract workers, at least in the short term. In the longer term, the labor market is at the beginning stages of a race between the challenges posed by deteriorating demographics and an aging workforce on one side, and the promise of AI tools to boost productivity and unleash innovation on the other. If the tools live up to their potential and adoption increases, they could help cover some emerging labor shortages and allow human workers to focus on more productive work. But if adoption does not increase and/or the tools prove too costly or cumbersome to implement at a wide scale, those emerging labor shortages may yet lead to more volatility and stagnating growth. The next year, and the years beyond, will shed more critical light on the state of this race.\nSubscribe to Indeed Hiring Lab\nThe latest insights on hiring and the economy, delivered straight to your inbox\nEmail* :\nThis is a carousel with 3 slides.

From Millennial leadership in the C-suite to the pressing need for \u201cupskilling\u201d talent, the way people work is rapidly changing.5,6 There are several key trends that will shape the workforce of the future, and understanding these shifts is essential for workers looking to thrive in the evolving job market.\n\n1. Millennial leadership in the C-suite\n\nMillennial leadership will begin to transform the C-suite. Millennials are known for their comfort with technology, their focus on work-life balance, and their desire for a more flexible, inclusive work culture. As they rise into leadership positions, they are likely to implement policies that cater to these values.\n\nOnly one in ten Americans want to reach the C-suite, according to Empower research on the changing face of senior leadership. Millennials, however, appear to be most eager to get to the corner office, with 39% wanting to make it to the boardroom.\n\nTake, for example, some of the first major Millennial CEOs: Damola Adamolekun, Red Lobster CEO, is 35 years old and tasked with turning around the chain as it exits bankruptcy.7\n\nKickstarter CEO Everette Taylor, aged 35, is overseeing the platform\u2019s first major changes in 15 years.8 Instacart CEO Fidji Simo is 39, and is in charge of the company\u2019s post-IPO future.9\n\n2. The rise of salary transparency\n\nSalary transparency may become more common in many industries this year. This shift would be driven by workers\u2019 pursuit of pay parity and the desire for companies to demonstrate their commitment to equity.10 According to Empower research, 67% of employees tie earning more money to job satisfaction. Those who are better paid may be more likely to stay at companies that are transparent about compensation.\n\nExpect to see more pay transparency in 2025 \u2014 and more companies leading the charge.\n\n3. Remote work continues to dominate\n\nRemote work, which took off during the pandemic, is here to stay. In fact, many companies have now accepted remote work as a permanent part of their operating model.\n\nThe Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) reports that 82% of executives intend to allow employees to work remotely at least part of the time, with 35% of job postings in 2024 being fully remote positions.11,12\n\nAn increasing number of companies use remote work to tap into a wider talent pool. As organizations become more flexible in their work arrangements, employees may enjoy better work-life balance and more control over their schedules.\n\n4. Upskilling for the AI revolution\n\nIn 2025, it\u2019s expected that artificial intelligence (AI) will not replace jobs. Rather, they will augment human capabilities. Many companies will focus on reskilling and upskilling their employees to ensure they can work alongside AI tools effectively.13 From customer service roles enhanced by chatbots to AI-assisted decision-making in leadership, workers will need to adapt to new technology.14\n\nMany companies already recognize the dual need to incorporate AI where it\u2019s useful while also upskilling employees to learn new AI-related skills. AI will become an essential part of business operations, and workers will level up to use these tools as an assistant for their daily tasks and more.15\n\n5. New benefits to address needs\n\nThe traditional benefits packages offered by employers will look vastly different by the end of this year. Although findings from Empower research demonstrate how the importance of conventional benefits, such as healthcare (70%) and dental care (53%), other perks, such as retirement advice (24%) and tuition assistance (11%), are growing in popularity.\n\nCompanies increasingly offer benefits that cater to these and other needs of their modern workforce. Take student loan assistance, for example: The SECURE Act 2.0 permits employers to offer matching retirement contributions to help employees offset student loan payments.\n\nMany benefits packages now emphasize mental health, flexible working arrangements, and other perks that focus on employees' well-being.16\n\nRead more: Smart strategies for managing student loan debt in retirement\n\n6. Employee wellness takes center stage\n\nEmployers are likely going to focus on employee wellness, both as a benefit but also as a cultural cornerstone. Companies are seeking unique ways to keep their employees, which means they could invest more in programs that address holistic needs.\n\nNearly three quarters (72%) of employers plan to enhance their mental health offerings, with more resources being devoted to employee assistance programs and digital tools to help employees manage stress.17 As burnout can be a challenge, these efforts will be essential in every healthy, engaged workforce.\n\n7. Tight competition for new graduates\n\nThe job market cooled across age groups in 2024, and despite rebounds for other demographics, the dip has largely remained for entry-level workers.18 The unemployment rate for recent graduates hit a high of 5.3% \u2014 the highest it's been in three years.19\n\nNewcomers to the working world can still get ahead in a competitive hiring market. To start, look backwards: Alumni associations can help make introductions between new graduates and those who are more established in their careers. Empower data indicates that 40% of Millennials have relied on their personal network to get their current job.\n\nEmbracing the future of work in 2025\n\nThe 2025 workplace could be defined by flexibility, innovation, and inclusivity. For workers, this may mean more opportunities to work remotely, more transparency in pay, and additional control over their careers.\n\nWorkers may want to prepare themselves by learning more about AI's role in their industry, what flexible work they may want in their current (or future) job, and how changes in compensation structures can help them get the most value from their work. For companies, this could transform how they operate.\n\nGet financially happy.\n\nPut your money to work for life and play.\n\n1 MIT Sloan Management Review, \u201cReturn-to-Office Mandates: How to Lose Your Best Performers,\u201d November 20242 Gallup, \u201cThe Future of the Office Has Arrived: It's Hybrid,\u201d October 20233 Forbes, \u201cThe Year In Remote Work\u20142024\u2019s Biggest Shifts,\u201d November 20244 MIT Sloan, \u201cHow generative AI affects highly skilled workers,\u201d November 20245 CEO Magazine, \u201cHow Millennial leaders are changing the business world for the better,\u201d July 2023\u00a06 Forbes, \u201cThe Rise Of Upskilling And Continuous Learning In A Slow Labor Market,\u201d September 20247 CNN Business, \u201cRed Lobster files for bankruptcy,\u201d May 20248 Entrepreneur, \u201c'Creators Left So Much Money on the Table': Kickstarter's CEO Reveal8 the Story Behind the Company's Biggest Changes in 15 Years,\u201d May 20249 Financial Times, \u201cInstacart IPO is latest stop on Fidji Simo\u2019s Silicon Valley ascent,\u201d September 202310 WTW, \u201cHow to meet pay transparency demands and advance fair pay,\u201d September 202311 SHRM, \u201cWhat Will the Workplace Look Like in 2025?\u201d12 Robert Half, \u201cRemote Work Statistics and Trends for 2024,\u201d November 202413 IBM, \u201cUpskilling and reskilling for talent transformation in the era of AI,\u201d Accessed January 202514 Harvard Business Review, \u201c6 Ways AI Changed Business in 2024, According to Executives,\u201d January 202515 Washington Post, \u201cI used AI work tools to do my job.

For companies, this could transform how they operate.\n\nGet financially happy.\n\nPut your money to work for life and play.\n\n1 MIT Sloan Management Review, \u201cReturn-to-Office Mandates: How to Lose Your Best Performers,\u201d November 20242 Gallup, \u201cThe Future of the Office Has Arrived: It's Hybrid,\u201d October 20233 Forbes, \u201cThe Year In Remote Work\u20142024\u2019s Biggest Shifts,\u201d November 20244 MIT Sloan, \u201cHow generative AI affects highly skilled workers,\u201d November 20245 CEO Magazine, \u201cHow Millennial leaders are changing the business world for the better,\u201d July 2023\u00a06 Forbes, \u201cThe Rise Of Upskilling And Continuous Learning In A Slow Labor Market,\u201d September 20247 CNN Business, \u201cRed Lobster files for bankruptcy,\u201d May 20248 Entrepreneur, \u201c'Creators Left So Much Money on the Table': Kickstarter's CEO Reveal8 the Story Behind the Company's Biggest Changes in 15 Years,\u201d May 20249 Financial Times, \u201cInstacart IPO is latest stop on Fidji Simo\u2019s Silicon Valley ascent,\u201d September 202310 WTW, \u201cHow to meet pay transparency demands and advance fair pay,\u201d September 202311 SHRM, \u201cWhat Will the Workplace Look Like in 2025?\u201d12 Robert Half, \u201cRemote Work Statistics and Trends for 2024,\u201d November 202413 IBM, \u201cUpskilling and reskilling for talent transformation in the era of AI,\u201d Accessed January 202514 Harvard Business Review, \u201c6 Ways AI Changed Business in 2024, According to Executives,\u201d January 202515 Washington Post, \u201cI used AI work tools to do my job.

As we kick off this new year, it\u2019s time to get a clear understanding of the key trends that will define hiring in the near future. While some of these predictions might sting a little, I\u2019d rather you be prepared than caught off guard. Let\u2019s dive into what you need to know, so you can stay ahead of the curve and position yourself for success in your dream role.\nThe End of Remote Work as a Standard Perk\nMore and more companies are pulling back from offering remote work as a standard perk. While some businesses will continue to offer full remote opportunities, the overall trend is shifting back toward in-office and hybrid models.\nIf you currently have a fully remote role and love it, now is the time to stick with it, especially if there are no plans to change your work setup. Do everything you can to prove your value remotely. Establish a strong routine, show measurable results, and keep open communication with your managers.\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re seeking a remote role, be prepared for more competition. Be flexible and open to hybrid positions where you might have to go into the office part-time. If you\u2019re applying to companies that offer hybrid roles, be sure to highlight your ability to be effective in both in-person and remote environments.\nThe Decline of Cover Letters\nThe traditional cover letter is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. In fact, 58% of professionals surveyed think cover letters are redundant. As a result, recruiters are increasingly focusing on tangible evidence of your skills \u2014 things like portfolios, case studies, or concrete work samples. This shift is particularly noticeable in industries where results speak louder than words, such as tech and design.\nMORE FOR YOU\n### Security Alert As 1 Billion Passwords Stolen, For Sale At $10\u2014Act Now\n### 4 Low Commitment Side Hustles That Can Pay $5,000 Per Month\n### California Wildfire Updates: New Blaze Burns Near Bel Air As Hughes Fire Explodes To 10,000 Acres\nMy advice? Ditch the cover letter and focus on creating a standout portfolio or personal website that highlights your best work. Tailor it to the job you\u2019re applying for, and ensure it\u2019s easy to navigate. Focus on experience! Show what you\u2019ve done in previous roles and the impact you\u2019ve made. Be ready to discuss specific examples during interviews, and let your work speak for itself.\nExperience Will Outweigh Formal Education, Especially in High-Tech Fields\nWhile formal education is still important, experience is becoming the ultimate differentiator, especially in fast-evolving fields like AI, machine learning, and software development. Companies want hands-on experience, whether you\u2019ve worked in the field, completed projects, or participated in relevant training. For many roles, a degree is no longer a requirement if your experience is more substantial. In fact, 4 in 5 employers now value hands-on experience over a traditional degree when evaluating job candidates.\nSo, if you\u2019re considering a career in a field like AI, prioritize skill-building and invest in online courses, workshops, or certifications to build your expertise. A portfolio of projects will always carry more weight than a degree alone. Also, look for internships, freelance work, or volunteer opportunities that will help you build real-world experience. Even side projects or personal projects can make a significant impact on your resume.\nAnd don\u2019t forget to showcase your results! Employers want to know how your experience translates to results. Make sure your resume and portfolio emphasize how you\u2019ve solved problems and contributed to previous employers\u2019 success.\nReferrals and Internal Moves Taking Center Stage\nThe old adage \"who you know\" is more relevant than ever. As companies continue to streamline their hiring processes, internal referrals and internal promotions will become increasingly important. More businesses are tapping their existing talent pools for new roles rather than seeking outside candidates. So, if you\u2019re looking to move up in your current company or make a lateral move, your internal network will be crucial.\nStart connecting with colleagues across different departments. Offer help, share ideas, and demonstrate your willingness to collaborate. Having a strong network within your company can open doors to internal opportunities. Furthermore, don\u2019t be afraid to ask for referrals. When applying to external companies, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to people in your network for referrals. People are more likely to vouch for you if they know you and can speak to your work ethic and skills.\nLinkedIn referrals are also gaining traction, so make sure your profile is up to date and aligns with your goals. Build connections and engage with people who work at companies you\u2019re interested in.\nFewer Layoffs, But Hiring Freezes May Occur\nWe\u2019re likely to see fewer widespread layoffs in 2025, but hiring freezes could become more common during times of economic uncertainty. Companies may hold off on hiring new employees or filling open roles, especially if they\u2019re facing budget cuts or uncertainty in the market. It\u2019s important to be prepared for this shift, as it can impact your job search and career trajectory.\nIf hiring freezes occur, look for opportunities to enhance your skill set or pivot to other industries or roles. Consider freelance or contract work to fill the gap. And remember, even during hiring freezes, companies still need talent. Keep applying, but be patient and ready for a longer hiring process. Take this time to network and stay visible to recruiters and hiring managers.\nYou can also use any downtime to acquire new skills or certifications that could make you more competitive when hiring picks up again. The more prepared you are, the better position you\u2019ll be in when opportunities arise.\nThe 2025 job market is going to be fast-paced and full of change. But instead of being anxious about what\u2019s to come, take charge of your career by staying informed and adaptable. Whether it\u2019s honing your skills, building your network, or embracing new trends, the key to landing your dream job is positioning yourself as the best candidate for today\u2019s market.

This is all happening while stakeholders push leaders to cut expenditures while pursuing faster growth.\nGartner research has identified three key challenges executives must tackle in 2025:\n\nNew demands for a future-ready workforce\nThe evolving roles of managers\nEmerging talent risks to the organization\n\nLeaders must understand how these forces will shape their organizations, as well as what actions they need to take to remain competitive, attract and retain top talent, and achieve desired business outcomes. Within these three challenges, Gartner has nine predictions for HR leaders in 2025.\nNew Demands for a Future-Ready Workforce\n1. As retirements surge and tech disruption continues, organizations will suffer from a loss of expertise.\nIn the world\u2019s largest economies, a larger proportion of the workforce will reach retirement age in 2025 than in any previous year on record, draining organizations of their most experienced employees at an accelerated rate.\nAt the same time, technology has upended the relationship between expert and novice employees across industries. AI has absorbed many of the functions previously provided by interns and support teams, leaving junior employees without the opportunities they need to learn and build expertise. Organizational leaders are beginning to wonder how they will develop future experts when the tasks used to develop novice employees are now being performed by AI.\nExacerbating this expertise drain is a concern shared by both senior and junior employees about a lack of hands-on training. A May 2024 Gartner survey of 3,375 employees found that six in 10 said they aren\u2019t getting the on-the-job coaching they need to support their core job skills.\nTo address this urgent threat, organizations will need to build their collective intelligence, using technology to ensure that knowledge can easily flow between experts who have skills and novice employees who need skills.\nSome organizations have established dedicated knowledge management teams that scrape information directly from experts\u2019 workflows \u2014 such as posts in Teams channels, product demos, emails sent providing clarifying answers to questions and Q&A sessions \u2014 to identify approaches and actions taken by their in-house experts. They then convert these findings into microlearnings, such as brief videos, articles or activities that teach a single task or activity, that other employees can leverage in their own work. Another approach used by leading companies is to employ workforce management tools that tell supervisors how well employees are performing different tasks and suggest microlearnings that they can push to employees who need more support.\n2. Organizations will restructure to take advantage of AI and other technological innovations.\nCEOs are focused on growth in 2025, with many citing technology, and AI specifically, as a significant facilitator. But there is widespread anxiety that the same structures that have brought organizations to this point will not be sufficient to propel them forward \u2014 and that the potential impact of technological innovations will be hampered by current organizational design.\nLimitations from murky decision rights, multi-layered approvals, complex hierarchies, and rigid role designs stood in the way of 2024 being the year AI changed organizations\u2019 trajectories. Leaders fear that without substantial change, these same structural barriers will hold back taking full advantage of future innovations as well.\nThis year, executives will make substantive changes to how their organizations operate \u2014 creating flatter, less-hierarchical organizations, centralizing corporate functions to reduce duplicative work and create consistency, and investing in agile learning practices for cross-functional teams.\n3. Companies will adopt \u201cnudgetech\u201d to bridge widening collaboration gaps.\nA 2024 Gartner survey of nearly 18,000 employees revealed that only 29% are satisfied with their collaboration at work \u2014 down from 36% in 2021. Further Gartner analysis found that satisfaction with collaboration has a critical impact on performance; employees who are satisfied with collaboration are stronger performers on average.\nTo restore effective collaboration and cohesion, leading companies will experiment with nudgetech, an emerging set of AI-powered tools that enable personalization at scale. For example, it can prompt employees to communicate based on a particular colleague\u2019s preferences (such as email instead of texts), remind managers of their direct reports\u2019 working styles, or generate custom communication tips. Nudgetech can create a double benefit: improved communication and increased behavior change.\nThe Evolving Role of Managers\n4. Seeking fairness, employees will embrace bots over bosses.\nResearch has found that management by algorithms \u2014 their use in scheduling, feedback, performance reviews, and promotion/hiring decisions \u2014 can be \u201calienating\u201d and come with social costs in the workplace. Despite this, employee surveys suggest they found algorithms to be more fair than their human counterparts. A June 2024 Gartner survey of more than 3,300 employees revealed that 57% believe humans are more biased than AI when it comes to making compensation decisions. And an October 2024 Gartner survey of nearly 3,500 employees found that 87% of employees think that algorithms could give fairer feedback than their managers right now.\nEmployees are embracing the idea that AI tools can increase, rather than erode, fairness in the workplace and highlight contributions that their managers could miss in more traditional performance management processes. Managers will still finalize major decisions, as the human in the loop verifying and validating the bots\u2019 recommendations. But for more everyday activities such as in-the-moment performance feedback, bots are likely to take on an increasing share of managers\u2019 tasks, especially for work that is digitally based, easily quantifiable, or supported by IoT sensors.\n5. Organizations will wrestle with how to retain high performers in the age of AI.\nBusiness leaders want employees to use AI to enhance productivity, reduce busy work, and free up their time and energy for more creative and strategic tasks. At the same time, AI tools can serve as a workplace competency filter \u2014 a way for mediocre or poor performers to make their most minimal efforts appear highly productive and impactful to their managers and colleagues.\nThis raises several questions, including:\n\nShould organizations distinguish between mediocre performers bolstered by AI and actual high performers?\nWithout distinguishing between augmented and independent performance, how can employers retain high performers and ensure effective internal talent pipelines and succession plans?\n\nCurrent best practices suggest managers should focus on the outcome of the work, not the process of getting there. But in the long run, organizations will need to figure out new ways to define and reward high performance as it becomes harder to differentiate employees whose work quality stems from their own efforts from those who are reliant on AI.\nHR will need to develop clear guidelines on the AI-generated work that is and is not acceptable and train managers to recognize when employees are relying too much on AI and to intervene appropriately. In some cases, organizations may need to make a more fundamental shift in how they recognize and reward employee contributions.\n6. Organizations will shift focus to inclusion and belonging \u2014 with unexpected benefits.\nIn 2024, DEI initiatives faced increasing politicization and scrutiny, creating considerable anxiety for executives, who find themselves in the tricky position of preserving the benefits of DEI while navigating complex and rapidly shifting external dynamics.\nIn 2025, most organizations will shift their investments toward fostering greater inclusion and belonging for all employees, as opposed to focusing primarily on representation and underrepresented talent. Leveraging inclusion and belonging will be seen as offering a competitive edge.\nThis shift does not mean workforce diversity becomes unimportant; instead, it becomes a consequence of successful inclusion and belonging programs, rather than the center of attention. Organizations that develop inclusive cultures and fair processes, such as standardized recruiting practices that benefit all candidates, inclusive management, and a focus on collaboration and connection, will experience balanced growth in hiring, promotions, and retention across demographic groups. In this way, workforce diversity becomes an outcome to monitor rather than the goal. If representation of diverse groups declines in the workforce, that serves as an indicator that there are issues with the inclusion and belonging initiatives. With this pivot, organizations will be able to maintain or enhance their workforce diversity while improving talent outcomes and innovation via increased inclusion and belonging.\nEmerging Talent Risks to the Organization\n7. \u201cAI-first\u201d organizations will destroy productivity in their search for it.\nAI can create serious risks, unpredictable costs, and negative behaviors that harm the organization. Many new AI tools come with higher out-of-pocket costs and create significant indirect costs, such as increased work friction, the need for new role design and workflows, barriers to adoption, and more.\nA July 2024 Gartner survey of more than 3,500 employees revealed one in five report that the technology their organization has adopted in the past two years has made their job harder, rather than easier or having no impact.\nThis year, progressive organizations will use an employee-centric lens with people at the center and technology features second. HR should take a leadership role in AI governance conversations to incorporate employee feedback about which workflows can be improved to increase productivity and innovation. This may include advocating for:\n\nThe need for retraining\nNew role design and workflows\nPerformance measurement that incentivizes new behaviors they want employees to demonstrate\nLearning curves and high workloads that prevent adoption\n\nWhen organizations take a human-first approach to AI, Gartner research has found that employees are 1.5 times more likely to be high performers and 2.3 times more likely to be highly engaged.\n8. Loneliness becomes a business risk, not just a well-being challenge.\nIn 2023, the U.S. Surgeon General called loneliness a public health crisis. Loneliness isn\u2019t just a well-being risk, it\u2019s an acute business risk. When employees are lonely, their engagement levels lag and their performance suffers. A 2024 Gartner survey of 18,000 employees revealed only 29% of employees globally feel satisfied with the interactions they have with coworkers, down from 36% in 2021.\nProximity alone will not cure loneliness. Gartner analysis revealed on-site workers have been even less satisfied with their interactions at work than hybrid or remote workers every year since 2021.\nProgressive organizations will take steps in 2025 to mitigate loneliness as they would any other business risk. Many will begin by targeting interactions within the workforce \u2014 actively guiding how employees collaborate with one another by identifying personalized connection needs and providing structured opportunities for employees to learn (or re-learn) how to interact positively with their colleagues. Gartner research finds that organizations that adopt this type of guided collaboration meet their profit goals 10% more often than peers that don\u2019t.\nThe push to mitigate the business impacts of loneliness can also extend to when employees are off the clock, with some organizations compensating employees for engaging in social activities of their choice. For example, Hinge offers employees a monthly $100 stipend to use for dates, and an increasing number of organizations are offering days off for volunteering activities.\n9. Employee activism drives companies to adopt responsible AI norms.\nContinued adoption of AI and automation in the workplace is inevitable. But in 2025, employee activism will be a driving force for defining what the employee\u2013AI partnership looks like.\nIn a July 2024 Gartner survey of 243 CIOs, only 21% said they focus on mitigating the potential negative impacts of AI on employee work, and only 20% said they focus on mitigating the potential negative impacts of AI on employee well-being. If technology leaders are not attempting to assess and reduce the harm caused by AI to their organization\u2019s employees, who is?\nIn the absence of organizational, government, or vendor action, employees are stepping up to shape the norms of human\u2013technology collaboration themselves via collective action, protests, open letters, and internal advocacy. Progressive organizations will embrace this, co-creating their AI strategy and values with employees, including crowdsourcing AI use cases directly from employees before deciding which capabilities to pilot and incorporating multiple avenues for collecting and evaluating employee feedback.\n. . .\nTrends lists like this are meant to provoke and inspire, but the sheer pace of change can make it difficult for executives to move past initial interest to substantive action. While most organizations cannot act on each of these nine trends, executive teams should work together to evaluate:\n\nWhich trends are likely to disproportionately impact your organization?\nWhich trends are most likely to impact critical talent segments for your organization in the next two years?\nWhich trends pose a threat to your strategic goals if you don\u2019t act on them?\n\nThe next step is to evaluate which trends offer an opportunity to differentiate your organization with talent or customers. Identifying the trends that offer a comparative advantage will lead to a larger, more substantive return on your investment.\nCV Viverito, Ben Cook, Kelly Armstrong, Kate McLaren-Poole, and Michael Falbo also contributed to this research.\nRecommended For You\n\n\n\nGenerative AI\nHow to Build Your Own AI Assistant\n\n\n\nJob Interviews\nUse the STAR Interview Method to Land Your Next Job\n\n\n\nManaging Yourself\nOur Favorite Management Tips on Strategic Thinking\n\n\n\nPodcast\nHow to Develop Your Executive Presence\n\n\nReaders Also Viewed These Items\n\n\n\nInevitable: Inside the Messy, Unstoppable Transition to Electric Vehicles\nBook\nBuy Now\n\n\n\nManaging Overthinking (HBR Emotional Intelligence Series)\nBook\nBuy Now\n\n\nRead more on Business management or related topics Collaboration and teams, Human resource management, Organizational culture, Organizational transformation, Leadership and managing people, Management, Managing people, AI and machine learning and Generative AI\n\nEmily Rose McRae is a senior director analyst covering the future of work and workforce transformation, and she leads the talent research initiative for executive leaders.
